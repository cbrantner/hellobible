    <h2>What Security Procedures Does hellobible Use To Protect Personal Information?</h2>
    <p>We use physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to assist us in preventing unauthorized access, maintaining
        data accuracy, and correctly using your Personal Information. Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, we use
        commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to your Personal Information to the employees, agents, and officers
        of hellobible who need the information for their jobs.</p>

    <h2>Will hellobible Disclose Information To Outside Parties?</h2>
    <p>hellobible may share information with its subsidiaries and other affiliated companies, and with other carefully selected
        vendors and business partners with whom we work (collectively, "Site Affiliates"). This includes companies that offer
        affinity, frequent-user, and reward programs; and, companies that perform marketing services and other business operations
        for us (including providing goods and services to our users, as necessary to complete transactions you request).
        All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep all information confidential and to use
        the customer information only to provide the services we ask them to perform for you and us. We may provide aggregate
        statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third party vendors,
        but these statistics do not include Personal Information. We may disclose Personal Information we collect from you
        if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary (a) to obey the law or comply
        with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) to protect and defend our rights or property or the rights
        or property of other users of our Site; or (c) to act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of users of
        our Site or the public. On a limited basis, we may also disclose your Personal Information to certain Site Affiliates
        for their use in contacting you, when we reasonably believe their products or services are complementary to your
        interests or hellobible’ business.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to transfer or sell our company assets in a merger, sale involving part or all of the business,
        reorganization or any other change in control. In these types of transactions, visitor information is
        typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if hellobible or its assets are acquired, or
        if hellobible goes out of business, enters into bankruptcy, or goes through some other change of control, your Personal
        Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>

    <h2>External Links</h2>
    <p>We are not responsible for how other companies or organizations collect, use, disclose, or secure the information that
        you provide them. If you choose to access a third party Site linked to our Site, you do so at your own risk and subject
        to any terms of service or privacy policy (if any) associated with such third party Sites.</p>

    <h2>Collection Of Information From Children</h2>
    <p>The Site is not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services. Protecting the privacy of children
        is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under
        18, and no part of our Site or Service is designed to attract people under 18. If we later learn that a user is under
        18, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from
        utilizing the Site and the Service.</p>

    <h2>Consent To Processing In The United States</h2>
    <p>By providing any Personal Information to hellobible, all users, including, without limitation, users in Canada and the
        member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and to the
        transfer of such Personal Information across international borders in accordance with hellobible' standard operations,
        including the collection, storage, and processing of such information in the United States of America.</p>

    <h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83, a California resident who has provided Personal Information to
        a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California
        customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any
        third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure
        of Personal Information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide
        a list of all third parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as
        a list of the categories of Personal Information that were disclosed. However, under the law, a business is not required
        to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a
        policy of not disclosing customer's Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless
        the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy.
        Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure
        of Personal Information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. Except as expressly stated in this
        Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively
        agree to such disclosure -- typically by opting in to receive information from a third party that is participating
        in some activity describes on our site. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing
        purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific activity, as we do not share information
        with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your Personal Information for use in direct marketing
        by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide Personal Information on our site. Please note that whenever
        you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's
        privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need
        to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always
        review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your
        information.
    </p>

    <p>However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses
        to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s Personal Information to third parties
        for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as
        the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer
        of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information and providing a cost free means to exercise that
        right.
    </p>

    <p>California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing info@hellobible.org.
        Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to
        respond to requests made by means other than through this email address.</p>
