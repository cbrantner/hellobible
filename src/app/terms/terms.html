    <p>Effective Date of Current Policy: November 21st, 2016</p>
    
    <p>hellobible, LLC (“HelloBible”, “we” or “us”) operates the website located at www.hellobible.org (the “Site”). 
        The following terms and conditions (the “Terms of Use”) govern your access to and use of the Site.</p>

    <p>Please read the Terms of Use carefully before you use the Site.
        By using the Site, you agree to these Terms of Use, including our Privacy Policy, found at <a ui-sref="privacy">Privacy Policy</a>,
        without qualification or limitation. If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy,
        you must not access or use the Site.</p>

    <h2>Privacy.</h2>

    <p>HelloBible is committed to helping you safeguard your privacy.
        Please review our <a ui-sref="privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for details about how we collect, use, and disclose your information.
        By using the Site, you consent to all actions taken by us with respect to your information in compliance with the <a ui-sref="privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Electronic Communications.</h2>
    <p>The communications between you and HelloBible use electronic means, whether you visit the Site or send us emails,
        or whether we post notices on the Site or communicate with you via email. For contractual purposes, you 
        (1) consent to receive communications from HelloBible in an electronic form, and
        (2) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that HelloBible
        provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were in writing.
        The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights.</p>

    <h2>Registration and Passwords.</h2>

    <p>In order to access certain services on the Site, you will be required to provide specific information.
        All information about you must be truthful, and you may not use any aliases or other means to mask your true identity.
        Any access codes or passwords provided should be safeguarded at all times.
        You are responsible for the security of your access codes and passwords and will be solely liable for any use or unauthorized use
        of the Site under such access codes or passwords. We may suspend or terminate your access at any time with or without notice.
        To understand how we use information collected from you, please read our <a ui-sref="privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.

    <h2>The Subscription Contract Between You And Us.</h2>

    <p>HelloBible offers two subscription types: renewable monthly subscriptions (“Monthly Subscriptions”);
        prepaid and renewable six (6) and twelve (12) month subscriptions (“Interval Subscriptions”).</p>

    <p>Monthly Subscriptions: By purchasing a Monthly Subscription, 
        you acknowledge that your subscription has an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring
        charges prior to cancellation. Your subscription will be automatically extended for successive monthly periods,
        at the then-current subscription rate. To cancel your Monthly Subscription at any time, you must logon to your account and
        follow the cancellation procedures or email us and we will do it for you. If you cancel, you may use your subscription
        until the end of your then-current subscription term. HelloBible may submit periodic charges (e.g., monthly) without further
        authorization from you, until you provide prior notice that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your
        payment method. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before HelloBible reasonably could act.</p>

    <p>Interval Subscriptions: By purchasing an Interval Subscription, you acknowledge that your subscription has an initial pre-payment
        feature for the then-current term. At the end of the then-current term, your subscription will be automatically extended for
        another identical term at the then-current subscription rate. You may only cancel your Interval Subscription prior to the
        beginning of the subsequent term.</p>

    <h2>Product Information; Limitation on Quantities.</h2>
