    <h1>Our Partnership with the Kilgoris Project</h1>

    <p class="lead" style="text-align:center;">
        Teach your child the importance of giving. Together we can make an impact!
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>We started an awesome partnership with the Kilgoris Project to support their great work in Kenya. The Kilgoris Project
        educates and feeds children of a Masaai village in southwest Kenya. They work with local leaders and families to
        operate schools, provide daily food and clean water.</b>

    <h2>The Kilgoris schools</h2>
    <p>The Kilgoris Project teachers and staff nourish the hearts, minds and bodies of more than 1,100 children every day. That
        impact stretches beyond the classroom into family life. Many students are the first in their families to attend school.

            <h3 class="media-heading">Preschools</h3>
            <p>Just like in the U.S., preschool students in Kenya love to learn letters and numbers, play outside, and sing
                songs with their teachers.</p>

            <p>At the five preschools run by The Kilgoris Project, in rural Kenya, children as young as three have access to
                loving teachers and the tools they need to begin their educational journey. They listen to their teachers
                read their favorite books, use flash cards to recognize letters, trace letters and shapes with markers, and
                arrange objects in patterns all to build the literacy skills they will need in the future.</p>

            <p>The Kilgoris Project has a new batch of Kindergarteners, and in Kenya they are known as "top class" or the oldest
                class in preschool. "Top class" loves to read, draw, sing, and learn their letters. They also join the big
                kids for breakfast and lunch at school and playground time.</p>

            <p>This month, we’re introducing you to one of the very first graduates of Intimigom Primary School – a Kilgoris
                Project school: Graduates Cynthia and Soila with the aunt celebrating graduation.</p>

            <p>In fall 2016, 22 Intimigom students wore red graduation robes and celebratory tinsel for their graduation ceremony.
                Many are the first in their family to graduate primary school (8th grade) and are setting an example for
                their younger brothers and sisters.</p>

    <h2>Clean Water in Kilgoris</h2>

        <div class="media-body">
            <p>For kids in rural Kenya, clean water goes hand-in-hand with learning. Without clean water and proper nutrition,
                students simply can’t learn.</p>
            <p>At schools run by The Kilgoris Project in rural Kenya, wells and rain-water collection systems help ensure students
                and teachers have access to clean water. Access to clean water also helps keep TKP’s seven school clean and
                safe. Teachers, staff and students are trained on proper hand-washing and food and water handling to help
                decrease the spread of illness and disease in the community.</p>

    <h2>Outside of school</h2>

    <p>Just like you, kids in rural Kenya have lots of interests and responsibilities outside of school. Students get up early
        in the morning to help their parents with chores like feeding animals, preparing tea and breakfast, and caring for
        younger siblings. They also get a chance to explore and develop their talents in art, dance, poetry and soccer activities:

            <p>One of the most popular activities at The Kilgoris Project rural Kenya is cultural dance. Girls of all ages gather
                with their teachers and practice dances and songs that highlight their Kenyan heritage. </p>

            <p>Do you like to play soccer? Kids in Kilgoris, Kenya love togames and sports, especially soccer. The Kilgoris
                Project recently partnered with the local community to support a soccer tournament drawing hundreds of players

            <h3 class="media-heading">Scouting</h3>
            <p>Just like many young children in the United States, students Kenya participate in scouting. They learn teamwork,
                leadership, camping and survival skills. The boys in this program show their leadership abilities on campus
                and build their skills at local scouting competitions. TKP's team even advanced to a National-level competition
                last spring!</p>
