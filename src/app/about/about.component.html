      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Founder. <span class="text-muted">Connie.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">I am a Christian mom of three and a teacher. Faith is an important part of my life. I am involved
        in a church community and lead a Bible study for moms. When my twins grew a little older, I was trying to find
        ways to live faith more vibrantly with my children at home. My desire was to nurture their faith and give them
        a spiritual foundation.</p>

          a Busy Family Life.</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">But I found myself struggling with this in the midst of our busy family life. It took effort to
        plan creative and engaging activities and it was hard to find the time to buy all the supplies. When sharing
        this with my Christian friends, I realized that I was not alone in this struggle. So many of us long to help
        our children grow in faith and thrive in relationship with Jesus.</p>

      <p class="lead">Soon the idea of a Bible subscription service for Christian families was born. God opened many
        doors to start HelloBible.</p>
      <p class="lead">HelloBible provides your family with materials to help you teach, learn, and grow in faith. Each
        month, HelloBible focuses on a specific Bible story. Each box contains a storybook, reading guide, and
        interactive craft projects to explore the Bible with your children at home.</p>
