							<h3>The Idea</h3>
							<p>Once we met on a playground and soon we became friends. We are moms, christians, and both have a professional background
								in education. Growing up in a christian family and learning about christian holidays and values is a very important
								part of our life. As parents we want our children to experience this as well. We want to introduce them to the beauty
								of the Bible and to talk about faith in our day to day life. Unfortunately, our busy family life makes this goal
								hard to achieve. So we wondered, wouldn’t it be awesome to get Bible crafts and ideas pre-made on a regular basis?
								Yes, it totally would! </p>

							<h3>Launching HelloBible</h3>
							<p>Connie’s passion for teaching and designing hands-on materials and Simone’s experience in education assembles a perfect
								team. Also, being moms helped us to make this idea a reality. Launching HelloBible is a big answer to our prayers.
								GOD is amazing! HelloBible changed our life and we love what we do.</p>

							<h3>Helping Children in Need</h3>
							<p >Another important part of HelloBible is our desire to help children in need by donating a portion of each box. We
								partner with a great organisation called THE KILGORIS PROJECT which educates and feeds children in Kenya. We are
								very grateful that HelloBible enables us to share God’s love with these children.</p>

							<h3 >Our Mission</h3>
							<p >We pray that HelloBible also is a blessing to you. We hope that your HelloBible box brings fun, joy and valuable time
								into your home each month. One friend said, “Getting a HelloBible box is like receiving a gift, that enables us to
								explore God’s great love in many ways.” This is our mission and we are looking forward to welcoming you into our
								awesome HelloBible community.</p>
