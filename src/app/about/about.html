		<p class="lead">I am a Christian mom of three and a teacher. Faith is an important part of my life. I am involved in a church community and lead a Bible study for moms. When my twins grew a little older, I was trying to find ways to live faith more vibrantly with my children at home. My desire was to nurture their faith and give them a spiritual foundation.</p>

		<p class="lead">But I found myself struggling with this in the midst of our busy family life. It took effort to plan creative and engaging activities and it was hard to find the time to buy all the supplies. When sharing this with my Christian friends, I realized that I was not alone in this struggle. So many of us long to help our children grow in faith and thrive in relationship with Jesus.</p>

							<h2>The Idea</h2>
							<p>Once we met on a playground, we soon became friends. We are moms, christians, and both have a professional background
								in education. Growing up in a christian family and learning about christian holidays and values has always been a
								very important part of our lifes. As parents, we also want to introduce our children to the beauty of the Bible and
								to talk about faith in our day to day life. Unfortunately, our busy family life makes this goal hard to achieve.
								<b>Wouldn’t it be awesome to get Bible crafts and ideas pre-made on a regular basis? Yes, it totally would!</b></p>
						</div>
					</li>

						<div class="timeline-right">

								<span class="fa fa-rocket"></span>
							</div>
							<h2>Launching HelloBible</h2>
							<p>Connie’s passion for teaching and designing hands-on materials and Simone’s experience as a social worker assembles
								a perfect team. Also, being moms helped us to make this idea a reality. Launching HelloBible is a big answer to our
								prayers.
								<b>GOD is amazing! HelloBible changed our life and we love what we do.</b></p>

							<h2>Helping Children in Need</h2>
							<p><b>Another important part of HelloBible is to help children in need by donating a portion of each box.</b> We partner with
								a great organization called THE KILGORIS PROJECT which educates and feeds children in Kenya. We are very grateful
								that God gives us the opportunity to be a blessing to these children and to get to know more about their life and
								their needs.</p>

							<h2>Our Mission</h2>
							<p>We pray that your HelloBible box brings fun, joy and valuable time into your home each month. A good friend said,
								<b>“Getting a HelloBible box is like receiving a gift, that enables you to explore God’s great love in many ways.”
								Our mission is to send this precious gift to you.</b> We are looking forward to welcoming you into our awesome HelloBible
								community.</p>
