		<p class="lead">I am a Christian mom of three and a teacher. Faith is an important part of my life. I am involved in a church community and lead a Bible study for moms. When my twins grew a little older, I was trying to find ways to live faith more vibrantly with my children at home. My desire was to nurture their faith and give them a spiritual foundation.</p>

		<h2 class="featurette-heading">Long to Help Our Children Grow in Faith. <span class="text-muted">In the Midst of a Busy Family Life.</span></h2>
		<p class="lead">But I found myself struggling with this in the midst of our busy family life. It took effort to plan creative and engaging activities and it was hard to find the time to buy all the supplies. When sharing this with my Christian friends, I realized that I was not alone in this struggle. So many of us long to help our children grow in faith and thrive in relationship with Jesus.</p>

		<p class="lead">Soon the idea of a Bible subscription service for Christian families was born. God opened many doors to start HelloBible.</p>
		<p class="lead">HelloBible provides your family with materials to help you teach, learn, and grow in faith. Each month, HelloBible focuses on a specific Bible story. Each box contains a storybook, reading guide, and interactive craft projects to explore the Bible with your children at home.</p>
