He welcomes, explains the crafts and knows a lot of great Bible Verses.Donkeys are humble and often serving behind the scenes. In the Bible donkeys are constantly mentioned and considered reliable helpers to the humans. The New Testament tells us that Jesus entered Jerusalem on a donkey while the crowd worshipped him. Why did Jesus ride on an unimportant donkey instead of a mighty horse in such an important occasion? This shows that Jesus is a humble king, nobody needs to be perfect in order to serve Jesus.Let's all be reminded by Danny the Donkey, that we are important to Jesus and that he wants to use us."
