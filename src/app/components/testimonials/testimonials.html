                        I loved it! I like that Jesus is tied into every story. This is a great way to point children to The Savior.

                        Not only are the crafts unique, but they also come with clear, attractive directions for assembly (which makes my teacher heart go pitter-patter).
                        In addition to the craft activities, the Noah’s Ark box also had thoughtful faith formation opportunities and discussion questions.
                        The questions are more meaningful than recalling simple facts from the story.

                        All Materials are included. I like that everything is there, I don’t have to go to the store. We are busy all week, it is great to have the pre-made box that puts it all together.Very appealing and high-quality materials. My 7 year old daughter really liked the story book and the fun mix of activities.
