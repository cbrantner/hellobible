We started our journey at the very beginning of the Bible in the book of Genesis to learn more about the awesome world God had created. Our Bible explorers read the storybook <b>"The story of creation"</b>. Each explorer painted a <b>colorful cotton bag</b> to use for grocery shopping instead of disposable bags. That way they can care for God’s creation. They also crafted a <b>picture frame</b> with their own photo to always remind them that God created each of us special and that he knows us and loves us. The families also went on a <b>prayer walk</b>, and thought about more ways to care for God’s creation.
