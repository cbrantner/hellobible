Just like in the U.S., preschool students in Kenya love to learn letters and numbers, play outside, and sing songs with their teachers.

At the five preschools run by The Kilgoris Project, in rural Kenya, children as young as three have access to loving teachers and the tools they need to begin their educational journey. They listen to their teachers read their favorite books, use flash cards to recognize letters, trace letters and shapes with markers, and arrange objects in patterns all to build the literacy skills they will need in the future.
