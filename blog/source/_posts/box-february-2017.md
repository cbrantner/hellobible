Our journey lead us to the Story of Noah’s Ark. We learned more about God’s plan with Noah and the animals. Our Bible explorer’s read the storybook <b>"A man named Noah"</b>. Each explorer built <b>an awesome ark and a matching game</b> which presents the fact that the animals came into the ark two by two. They also made beautiful <b>giant rainbow bubbles</b> to remind them of the promise God gave to Noah that he never sends such a flood again. The families also went to a park to <b>measure how huge the ark really was</b>, according to the dimensions given in the Bible.
