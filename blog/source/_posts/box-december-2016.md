Our journey lead us to a very important Bible story in the New Testament: The story of Christmas. Praise be to God for sending His son Jesus! Our Bible explorers read the storybook <b>"Baby Jesus is born"</b>. Each explorer made a <b>beautiful nativity scene</b>. They acted out the Bible story with their self made nativity figures and the families played a game to bring the shepherds and the three kings to the stable to Jesus. They also crafted <b>bright Christmas lights</b> and learned about <b>ways to let their own light shine</b>.
