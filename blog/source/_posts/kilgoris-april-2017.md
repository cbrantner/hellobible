Just like you, kids in rural Kenya have lots of interests and responsibilities outside of school.

<!-- more -->

Students get up early in the morning to help their parents with chores like feeding animals, preparing tea and breakfast, and caring for younger siblings.
At The Kilgoris Schools they also get a chance to explore and develop their talents in art, dance, poetry and soccer.

The Kilgoris Project schools are also home to vibrant Christian communities who gather together on Sunday mornings.
