In March, we prepared for Easter. We think that it is very important for children to know why we celebrate this important holiday. We focussed on the Easter week and the days that led to Jesus resurrection.

Our Bible explorer’s read the storybook “The days that led to Easter”. Each explorer painted a beautiful light ray Easter cross on a canvas. The empty cross symbolizes that Jesus is risen! They also planted sunflower seeds and helped them grow. They learned to take responsibility for a plant and observed new life growing out of little seeds. The families also made Easter cards together and engaged in the story through Easter sticker scenes.
